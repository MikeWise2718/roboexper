# Experiment 1

Notes, this is a master, don't run it on this, make a copy and play with that

This mimic I copy a directory to my laptop, go away, work on it, and now want to merge it back in
- dir1 - is the original with 4 files, a.txt, b.txt, c.txt, d.txt each with one letter of data
- dir2 - has changes in it b.txt has been modified, d.txt has been deleted, and an e.txt has been added


# diff output
- using bash from this directory `diff brief dir1 dir2` yields the following output:



# robocopy
